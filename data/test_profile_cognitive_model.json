I was cool with that, I figured we would get close and maybe one day we\u2019d be together, but I wasn\u2019t letting my hopes get too high. We\u2019ve been talking nonstop since then, hung out several times and every time I interact with her I get deeper in my feelings for her. So I have been trying for a while to find an opportunity to confess my feelings to her and get some closure on whether or not we\u2019d ever be together. Well last night she told me she had a crush on like my closest friend. I\u2019m broken inside. I\u2019ve held it together on the outside and told her if she wants my friend she should try for him, he\u2019s a good guy and she deserves to be happy. But I\u2019m suffering inside. I\u2019m never going to tell them how sad this makes me because they shouldn\u2019t feel uncomfortable pursuing a relationship because of me. But I want to cry. But I can\u2019t.

My username was chosen because I was always the person my family relied on, I helped out where I could for example babysitting a cousin 3 or 4 times weekly for the whole day when the mother was at work and I \"only studying at home\". The father just started being self-employed so they needed the extra income. I even picked my babycousin up and drove her back although my gasmoney was always short, as short as me usually declining to go out with friends.  Now my cousins company makes great profits and yesterday he got himself and his wife again a new car.   I\u00b4m still counting every cent and can\u00b4t make any \"fun\" purchases.  I don\u00b4t want to feel jelous but I am and it\u00b4s starting to take me to a deep spot again.  On the one side I wish them all the best and all the success imaginable. On the other side I feel used because I helped them out when they needed it the most and I never even got an invite to a restaurant or anything from them. Every other person visiting them gets invited somewhere. I feel they were and are so damn ungrateful towards me. I would be happy with a simple \"thank you everyonepulls because of you we had it easier to deal with everything\".  Nothing along the lines ever came...

I dropped out of college, had several jobs I all got fired from, the last one was 6 months ago and since I haven't got back into anything, currently living with my mom in a one bedroom apartment not knowing what to do with anything.  Not sure if it's your cup of tea, or if it will help, but Mark Manson has a lot of aphorisms.

Yeah, I'm actually a bit surprised myself, but I guess it stems from that helping people is the most meaningful thing I know. I just decided that it was better spending my time listening to people and try to help them than watching Netflix or whatever the whole day. Hopefully I'm on my way up and will get better soon. "

If you really feel pushed to do the school thing but can't afford it, you must justify in your head that being financially responsible is totally a justifiable mean. I personally am just graduating with my associates this semester, and I am 25. However, financially I've gained a lot of responsibility, and I think I've earned alot of character in the work field. Yes I am earning an amateur degree rather late, however I have no debt, in fact I have a large surplus of money.

                "content": "Hey all, it's sort of been awhile since I've decided to do anything on Reddit. Just wanted to tell you a quick story and how it's left me.  5 months ago, I attempted suicide and fortunately I slowly started losing consciousness on my girlfriend's bed where she found me and promptly somehow resusciated me. We both cried, I told her she should've just let me.  Two months later, my girlfriend had a break down and started packing her things and when I asked where she was going, she told me she was going up the mountains where we had first met, and where we wanted to eventually get married. I knew what she meant by that and I told her if she did some stupid shit like that I would go with her. She responded to me with, \"Okay, let's go then\". I became seriously afraid. I knew she was dead set and even me passing away with her wouldn't have stopped her. I called the non-emergency line and she fought for the phone. Nothing happened that night.  On the morning of April 11th, my girlfriend texted me around 4 am. She said she couldn't sleep. We started arguing over nonsense, and she told me that she was writing in her journal (like she usually does). I got mad because I thought she was writing something negative about me. About 2 hours later she calls me while she was driving over to my house to see me, she said that she only had written good things about me, and said she was going to come pick me up. She arrived at my house, she had no makeup and she had clearly been crying a lot, her 3 year old son was left at home asleep.   We went to the bar, had a drink and smoked our cigarettes and vented/argued. We then left, and she dropped me off at my house. I was angry so I didn't give her a hug or kiss even though she grabbed me and tried to make me, I didn't even look at her. She called me about 5 minutes later and told me to look in my mailbox, inside the mailbox was my note for me, saying her goodbye. I wailed and my heart dropped down into my stomach. I hung up on her and called 911 and I knew exactly where she would go, those mountains, and I knew the exact spot in the mountains. She sent me all of the money she had left in her bank account on Venmo. She made her last phone call to me, and just repeated \"Michael, talk to me. Please just talk to me. Talk to me\". I only yelled and screamed that the police were on their way and to please stop. She hung up on me.  That was the last I heard of her. My girlfriend died waiting for a helicopter to pick her up after she hung herself. When I got the news, I pounded my head on the concrete and punched the sidewalk. The police had to hold me down.   Later that night, I stole my father's car and drove to the very same spot and tried hanging myself, the police got there and stopped me, I was sent to the hospital and stayed there for 7 days, grieving alone.  To this day, I wonder what I could've done better. If I had just talked to her, could I have talked her down? If I hugged or kissed her, would she have been okay?   I'm not okay. I wish I had died that night. But I'm trying to recover, I'm trying to find purpose in waking up, in eating, in making friends. I find no interest in anything. The girl I was supposed to marry and have a child with is gone.   The only thing that gives me happiness is knowing that her pain is gone. Her cervical cancer, her past of sexual abuse, the pain she felt from her mother taking her own life.   Where do I go from here?"
